Customise !!!!\nAdd more fonts that you want to use for your website\n\n\nFont sizes (example)\n\nTitle size = 40px\n\nBody size = 18px\n\nCode size = 16px\nAlways knit to see pages until you are happy with font type and size\nStep 3: Choose color palette\nGo to coolers website\nMake a palette and download for later use.\nYou can lock colors or press space bar for new colors\nYou can export to pdf (HEX and RGB)\nTo change the banner at the top of website go to coding section (my_theme.css file) as shown in pic and here you can change :\n\nExample\nTitle size = 28px (how big do you want the banner to be)\nText color = what colour do you want the text to be\nText size = 28px (size of text)\nHover color = white (when you move mouse over the writing what colour should it change into)\nBackground color = #C34A79 (The colour of the banner)\nStep 6: After making all the changes you want save on github\nCommit- push to save on website\nLesson 5\nLearning objectives:\nChanging the font colours\nChange button colours\nInclude a navigation bar\nAdd table of contents\nStep 1: Copy this code at the bottom of css file\n\nh1 {\n      color: #C34A79;\n      font-size: 36px;\n    }\n\nNow you can change the colour and font size of your biggest header on website\nStep2: And now copy this code underneath to change button colours\n\n  .btn-outline-dark {\n        background-color: transparent; \n        color: rgba(195, 74, 121);\n        border: 1px solid;\n        border-color: rgba(195, 74, 121);\n    }\n    \n\n    .btn-outline-dark:hover {\n        background-color: rgba(195, 74, 121);\n        border-color: rgba(195, 74, 121);\n        color: white;\n    }\n\nNow you change colours of button using coolers.co website. Also look at R Grils github for further codes.\nStep 3: Menu bar (dropdown)\nGo to _Site.yml\nThe menu argument allows you to add dropdown options so the main button will say lesson plans and then you can have the choice to pick which type of lesson plan\nMake sure the spaces are properly formatted or you‚Äôll get an error (even one tab off on menu as example)\nNote: the links won‚Äôt work yet because we haven‚Äôt created the pages yet\n\n\n\n\n",
